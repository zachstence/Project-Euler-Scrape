"","","","","","","Each character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the preferred standard is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). For example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and lowercase k = 107.
A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes to ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret key. The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key on the cipher text, restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42 = 107, then 107 XOR 42 = 65.
For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and without both ""halves"", it is impossible to decrypt the message.
Unfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than the message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout the message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long password key for security, but short enough to be memorable.
Your task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three lower case characters. Using cipher.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a file containing the encrypted ASCII codes, and the knowledge that the plain text must contain common English words, decrypt the message and find the sum of the ASCII values in the original text.","<p>Each character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the preferred standard is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange).

"","","","","","","In the game, Monopoly, the standard board is set up in the following way:
GO A1 CC1 A2 T1 R1 B1 CH1 B2 B3 JAIL
H2 C1
T2 U1
H1 C2
CH3 C3
R4 R2
G3 D1
CC3 CC2
G2 D2
G1 D3
G2J F3 U2 F2 F1 R3 E3 E2 CH2 E1 FP
A player starts on the GO square and adds the scores on two 6-sided dice to determine the number of squares they advance in a clockwise direction. Without any further rules we would expect to visit each square with equal probability: 2.5%. However, landing on G2J (Go To Jail), CC (community chest), and CH (chance) changes this distribution.
In addition to G2J, and one card from each of CC and CH, that orders the player to go directly to jail, if a player rolls three consecutive doubles, they do not advance the result of their 3rd roll. Instead they proceed directly to jail.
At the beginning of the game, the CC and CH cards are shuffled. When a player lands on CC or CH they take a card from the top of the respective pile and, after following the instructions, it is returned to the bottom of the pile. There are sixteen cards in each pile, but for the purpose of this problem we are only concerned with cards that order a movement; any instruction not concerned with movement will be ignored and the player will remain on the CC/CH square.
Community Chest (2/16 cards):
Advance to GO
Go to JAIL
Chance (10/16 cards):
Advance to GO
Go to JAIL
Go to C1
Go to E3
Go to H2
Go to R1
Go to next R (railway company)
Go to next R
Go to next U (utility company)
Go back 3 squares.
The heart of this problem concerns the likelihood of visiting a particular square. That is, the probability of finishing at that square after a roll. For this reason it should be clear that, with the exception of G2J for which the probability of finishing on it is zero, the CH squares will have the lowest probabilities, as 5/8 request a movement to another square, and it is the final square that the player finishes at on each roll that we are interested in. We shall make no distinction between ""Just Visiting"" and being sent to JAIL, and we shall also ignore the rule about requiring a double to ""get out of jail"", assuming that they pay to get out on their next turn.
By starting at GO and numbering the squares sequentially from 00 to 39 we can concatenate these two-digit numbers to produce strings that correspond with sets of squares.
Statistically it can be shown that the three most popular squares, in order, are JAIL (6.24%) = Square 10, E3 (3.18%) = Square 24, and GO (3.09%) = Square 00. So these three most popular squares can be listed with the six-digit modal string: 102400.
If, instead of using two 6-sided dice, two 4-sided dice are used, find the six-digit modal string.","<p>In the game, <i>Monopoly</i>, the standard board is set up in the following way:</p><div style=""text-align:center;""><table style=""background-color:#333333;"" align=""center"" cellspacing=""1"" cellpadding=""5"" border=""0""><tbody><tr><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">GO</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">A1</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">CC1</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">A2</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">T1</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">R1</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">B1</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">CH1</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">B2</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">B3</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">JAIL</td></tr><tr><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">H2</td><td colspan=""9"">&nbsp;</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">C1</td></tr><tr><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">T2</td><td colspan=""9"">&nbsp;</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">U1</td></tr><tr><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">H1</td><td colspan=""9"">&nbsp;</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">C2</td></tr><tr><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">CH3</td><td colspan=""9"">&nbsp;</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">C3</td></tr><tr><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">R4</td><td colspan=""9"">&nbsp;</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">R2</td></tr><tr><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">G3</td><td colspan=""9"">&nbsp;</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">D1</td></tr><tr><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">CC3</td><td colspan=""9"">&nbsp;</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">CC2</td></tr><tr><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">G2</td><td colspan=""9"">&nbsp;</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">D2</td></tr><tr><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">G1</td><td colspan=""9"">&nbsp;</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">D3</td></tr><tr><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">G2J</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">F3</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">U2</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">F2</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">F1</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">R3</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">E3</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">E2</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">CH2</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">E1</td><td style=""background-color:#ffffff;"">FP</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>A player starts on the GO square and adds the scores on two 6-sided dice to determine the number of squares they advance in a clockwise direction.

"","","","","","","A natural number, N, that can be written as the sum and product of a given set of at least two natural numbers, {a1, a2, ... , ak} is called a product-sum number: N = a1 + a2 + ... + ak = a1 × a2 × ... × ak.
For example, 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 × 2 × 3.
For a given set of size, k, we shall call the smallest N with this property a minimal product-sum number. The minimal product-sum numbers for sets of size, k = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are as follows.
k=2: 4 = 2 × 2 = 2 + 2
k=3: 6 = 1 × 2 × 3 = 1 + 2 + 3
k=4: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 4 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4
k=5: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2
k=6: 12 = 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 2 × 6 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 6
Hence for 2≤k≤6, the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers is 4+6+8+12 = 30; note that 8 is only counted once in the sum.

"","","","","","","Each of the six faces on a cube has a different digit (0 to 9) written on it; the same is done to a second cube. By placing the two cubes side-by-side in different positions we can form a variety of 2-digit numbers.
For example, the square number 64 could be formed:
In fact, by carefully choosing the digits on both cubes it is possible to display all of the square numbers below one-hundred: 01, 04, 09, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and 81.
For example, one way this can be achieved is by placing {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} on one cube and {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9} on the other cube.
However, for this problem we shall allow the 6 or 9 to be turned upside-down so that an arrangement like {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7} allows for all nine square numbers to be displayed; otherwise it would be impossible to obtain 09.
In determining a distinct arrangement we are interested in the digits on each cube, not the order.
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is equivalent to {3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 5}
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is distinct from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9}

"","","","","","","If we are presented with the first k terms of a sequence it is impossible to say with certainty the value of the next term, as there are infinitely many polynomial functions that can model the sequence.
As an example, let us consider the sequence of cube numbers. This is defined by the generating function,
un = n3: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, ...
Suppose we were only given the first two terms of this sequence. Working on the principle that ""simple is best"" we should assume a linear relationship and predict the next term to be 15 (common difference 7). Even if we were presented with the first three terms, by the same principle of simplicity, a quadratic relationship should be assumed.
We shall define OP(k, n) to be the nth term of the optimum polynomial generating function for the first k terms of a sequence. It should be clear that OP(k, n) will accurately generate the terms of the sequence for n ≤ k, and potentially the first incorrect term (FIT) will be OP(k, k+1); in which case we shall call it a bad OP (BOP).
As a basis, if we were only given the first term of sequence, it would be most sensible to assume constancy; that is, for n ≥ 2, OP(1, n) = u1.
Hence we obtain the following OPs for the cubic sequence:
OP(1, n) = 1 1, 1, 1, 1, ...
OP(2, n) = 7n−6 1, 8, 15, ...
OP(3, n) = 6n2−11n+6 1, 8, 27, 58, ...
OP(4, n) = n3 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, ...
Clearly no BOPs exist for k ≥ 4.
By considering the sum of FITs generated by the BOPs (indicated in red above), we obtain 1 + 15 + 58 = 74.

"","","","","","","In the game of darts a player throws three darts at a target board which is split into twenty equal sized sections numbered one to twenty.
The score of a dart is determined by the number of the region that the dart lands in. A dart landing outside the red/green outer ring scores zero. The black and cream regions inside this ring represent single scores. However, the red/green outer ring and middle ring score double and treble scores respectively.
At the centre of the board are two concentric circles called the bull region, or bulls-eye. The outer bull is worth 25 points and the inner bull is a double, worth 50 points.
There are many variations of rules but in the most popular game the players will begin with a score 301 or 501 and the first player to reduce their running total to zero is a winner. However, it is normal to play a ""doubles out"" system, which means that the player must land a double (including the double bulls-eye at the centre of the board) on their final dart to win; any other dart that would reduce their running total to one or lower means the score for that set of three darts is ""bust"".
When a player is able to finish on their current score it is called a ""checkout"" and the highest checkout is 170: T20 T20 D25 (two treble 20s and double bull).
There are exactly eleven distinct ways to checkout on a score of 6:
D3
D1 D2
S2 D2
D2 D1
S4 D1
S1 S1 D2
S1 T1 D1
S1 S3 D1
D1 D1 D1
D1 S2 D1
S2 S2 D1
Note that D1 D2 is considered different to D2 D1 as they finish on different doubles. However, the combination S1 T1 D1 is considered the same as T1 S1 D1.
In addition we shall not include misses in considering combinations; for example, D3 is the same as 0 D3 and 0 0 D3.

"","","","","","","Considering 4-digit primes containing repeated digits it is clear that they cannot all be the same: 1111 is divisible by 11, 2222 is divisible by 22, and so on. But there are nine 4-digit primes containing three ones:
1117, 1151, 1171, 1181, 1511, 1811, 2111, 4111, 8111
We shall say that M(n, d) represents the maximum number of repeated digits for an n-digit prime where d is the repeated digit, N(n, d) represents the number of such primes, and S(n, d) represents the sum of these primes.
So M(4, 1) = 3 is the maximum number of repeated digits for a 4-digit prime where one is the repeated digit, there are N(4, 1) = 9 such primes, and the sum of these primes is S(4, 1) = 22275. It turns out that for d = 0, it is only possible to have M(4, 0) = 2 repeated digits, but there are N(4, 0) = 13 such cases.
In the same way we obtain the following results for 4-digit primes.

A row measuring n units in length has red blocks with a minimum length of m units placed on it, such that any two red blocks (which are allowed to be different lengths) are separated by at least one black square.
Let the fill-count function, F(m, n), represent the number of ways that a row can be filled.
For example, F(3, 29) = 673135 and F(3, 30) = 1089155.
That is, for m = 3, it can be seen that n = 30 is the smallest value for which the fill-count function first exceeds one million.
In the same way, for m = 10, it can be verified that F(10, 56) = 880711 and F(10, 57) = 1148904, so n = 57 is the least value for which the fill-count function first exceeds one million.

"","","","","","","A row of five black square tiles is to have a number of its tiles replaced with coloured oblong tiles chosen from red (length two), green (length three), or blue (length four).
If red tiles are chosen there are exactly seven ways this can be done.
If green tiles are chosen there are three ways.
And if blue tiles are chosen there are two ways.
Assuming that colours cannot be mixed there are 7 + 3 + 2 = 12 ways of replacing the black tiles in a row measuring five units in length.
How many different ways can the black tiles in a row measuring fifty units in length be replaced if colours cannot be mixed and at least one coloured tile must be used?

The section corresponding to −0.01 ≤ x ≤ +0.01 at the top is missing, allowing the light to enter and exit through the hole.
The light beam in this problem starts at the point (0.0,10.1) just outside the white cell, and the beam first impacts the mirror at (1.4,-9.6).
Each time the laser beam hits the surface of the ellipse, it follows the usual law of reflection ""angle of incidence equals angle of reflection."" That is, both the incident and reflected beams make the same angle with the normal line at the point of incidence.
In the figure on the left, the red line shows the first two points of contact between the laser beam and the wall of the white cell; the blue line shows the line tangent to the ellipse at the point of incidence of the first bounce.

"","","","","","","In a triangular array of positive and negative integers, we wish to find a sub-triangle such that the sum of the numbers it contains is the smallest possible.
In the example below, it can be easily verified that the marked triangle satisfies this condition having a sum of −42.
We wish to make such a triangular array with one thousand rows, so we generate 500500 pseudo-random numbers sk in the range ±219, using a type of random number generator (known as a Linear Congruential Generator) as follows:
t := 0
for k = 1 up to k = 500500:
t := (615949*t + 797807) modulo 220
sk := t−219
Thus: s1 = 273519, s2 = −153582, s3 = 450905 etc
Our triangular array is then formed using the pseudo-random numbers thus:
s1
s2 s3
s4 s5 s6
s7 s8 s9 s10
...
Sub-triangles can start at any element of the array and extend down as far as we like (taking-in the two elements directly below it from the next row, the three elements directly below from the row after that, and so on).
The ""sum of a sub-triangle"" is defined as the sum of all the elements it contains.

"","","","","","","As we all know the equation x2=-1 has no solutions for real x.
If we however introduce the imaginary number i this equation has two solutions: x=i and x=-i.
If we go a step further the equation (x-3)2=-4 has two complex solutions: x=3+2i and x=3-2i.
x=3+2i and x=3-2i are called each others' complex conjugate.
Numbers of the form a+bi are called complex numbers.
In general a+bi and a−bi are each other's complex conjugate.
A Gaussian Integer is a complex number a+bi such that both a and b are integers.
The regular integers are also Gaussian integers (with b=0).
To distinguish them from Gaussian integers with b ≠ 0 we call such integers ""rational integers.""
A Gaussian integer is called a divisor of a rational integer n if the result is also a Gaussian integer.
If for example we divide 5 by 1+2i we can simplify in the following manner:
Multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of 1+2i: 1−2i.
The result is .
So 1+2i is a divisor of 5.
Note that 1+i is not a divisor of 5 because .
Note also that if the Gaussian Integer (a+bi) is a divisor of a rational integer n, then its complex conjugate (a−bi) is also a divisor of n.
In fact, 5 has six divisors such that the real part is positive: {1, 1 + 2i, 1 − 2i, 2 + i, 2 − i, 5}.

"","","","","","","A segment is uniquely defined by its two endpoints.
By considering two line segments in plane geometry there are three possibilities:
the segments have zero points, one point, or infinitely many points in common.
Moreover when two segments have exactly one point in common it might be the case that that common point is an endpoint of either one of the segments or of both. If a common point of two segments is not an endpoint of either of the segments it is an interior point of both segments.
We will call a common point T of two segments L1 and L2 a true intersection point of L1 and L2 if T is the only common point of L1 and L2 and T is an interior point of both segments.
Consider the three segments L1, L2, and L3:
L1: (27, 44) to (12, 32)
L2: (46, 53) to (17, 62)
L3: (46, 70) to (22, 40)
It can be verified that line segments L2 and L3 have a true intersection point. We note that as the one of the end points of L3: (22,40) lies on L1 this is not considered to be a true point of intersection. L1 and L2 have no common point. So among the three line segments, we find one true intersection point.
Now let us do the same for 5000 line segments. To this end, we generate 20000 numbers using the so-called ""Blum Blum Shub"" pseudo-random number generator.
s0 = 290797
sn+1 = sn×sn (modulo 50515093)
tn = sn (modulo 500)
To create each line segment, we use four consecutive numbers tn. That is, the first line segment is given by:
(t1, t2) to (t3, t4)
The first four numbers computed according to the above generator should be: 27, 144, 12 and 232. The first segment would thus be (27,144) to (12,232).

A set of three primes is called a prime triplet if one of the three primes has the other two as neighbours in the triangle.
For example, in the second row, the prime numbers 2 and 3 are elements of some prime triplet.
If row 8 is considered, it contains two primes which are elements of some prime triplet, i.e. 29 and 31.
If row 9 is considered, it contains only one prime which is an element of some prime triplet: 37.
Define S(n) as the sum of the primes in row n which are elements of any prime triplet.
Then S(8)=60 and S(9)=37.
You are given that S(10000)=950007619.
Find S(5678027) + S(7208785).","<p>Build a triangle from all positive integers in the following way:</p><p style=""font-family:'courier new', monospace;font-weight:bold;margin-left:50px;"">&nbsp;1<br>&nbsp;<span style=""color:#FF0000;"">2</span>&nbsp; <span style=""color:#FF0000;"">3</span><br>&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=""color:#FF0000;"">5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br>&nbsp;<span style=""color:#FF0000;"">7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;9 10<br><span style=""color:#FF0000;"">11</span> 12 <span style=""color:#FF0000;"">13</span> 14 15<br>16 <span style=""color:#FF0000;"">17</span> 18 <span style=""color:#FF0000;"">19</span> 20 21<br>22 <span style=""color:#FF0000;"">23</span> 24 25 26 27 28<br><span style=""color:#FF0000;"">29</span> 30 <span style=""color:#FF0000;"">31</span> 32 33 34 35 36<br><span style=""color:#FF0000;"">37</span> 38 39 40 <span style=""color:#FF0000;"">41</span> 42 <span style=""color:#FF0000;"">43</span> 44 45<br>46 <span style=""color:#FF0000;"">47</span> 48 49 50 51 52 <span style=""color:#FF0000;"">53</span> 54 55<br>56 57 58 <span style=""color:#FF0000;"">59</span> 60 <span style=""color:#FF0000;"">61</span> 62 63 64 65 66<br>. . .</p><p>Each positive integer has up to eight neighbours in the triangle.</p><p>A set of three primes is called a <i>prime triplet</i> if one of the three primes has the other two as neighbours in the triangle.</p><p>For example, in the second row, the prime numbers 2 and 3 are elements of some prime triplet.</p><p>If row 8 is considered, it contains two primes which are elements of some prime triplet, i.e. 29 and 31.<br>If row 9 is considered, it contains only one prime which is an element of some prime triplet: 37.</p><p>Define S(<var>n</var>) as the sum of the primes in row <var>n</var> which are elements of any prime triplet.<br>Then S(8)=60 and S(9)=37.</p><p>You are given that S(10000)=950007619.</p><p>Find &nbsp;S(5678027) + S(7208785).</p>","","","",""

"","","","","","","A best approximation to a real number x for the denominator bound d is a rational number r/s (in reduced form) with s ≤ d, so that any rational number p/q which is closer to x than r/s has q > d.
Usually the best approximation to a real number is uniquely determined for all denominator bounds. However, there are some exceptions, e.g. 9/40 has the two best approximations 1/4 and 1/5 for the denominator bound 6. We shall call a real number x ambiguous, if there is at least one denominator bound for which x possesses two best approximations. Clearly, an ambiguous number is necessarily rational.
How many ambiguous numbers x = p/q, 0 < x < 1/100, are there whose denominator q does not exceed 108?","<p>A best approximation to a real number <var>x</var> for the denominator bound <var>d</var> is a rational number <var>r</var>/<var>s</var> (in reduced form) with <var>s</var> ≤ <var>d</var>, so that any rational number <var>p</var>/<var>q</var> which is closer to <var>x</var> than <var>r</var>/<var>s</var> has <var>q</var> &gt; <var>d</var>.</p><p>Usually the best approximation to a real number is uniquely determined for all denominator bounds.

"","","","","","","Three circles of equal radius are placed inside a larger circle such that each pair of circles is tangent to one another and the inner circles do not overlap. There are four uncovered ""gaps"" which are to be filled iteratively with more tangent circles.
At each iteration, a maximally sized circle is placed in each gap, which creates more gaps for the next iteration. After 3 iterations (pictured), there are 108 gaps and the fraction of the area which is not covered by circles is 0.06790342, rounded to eight decimal places.
What fraction of the area is not covered by circles after 10 iterations?
