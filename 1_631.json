For n\u22651, derive Dn from Dn-1 by the string-rewriting rules:\n\"a\" \u2192 \"aRbFR\"\n\"b\" \u2192 \"LFaLb\"\nThus, D0 = \"Fa\", D1 = \"FaRbFR\", D2 = \"FaRbFRRLFaLbFR\", and so on.\nThese strings can be interpreted as instructions to a computer graphics program, with \"F\" meaning \"draw forward one unit\", \"L\" meaning \"turn left 90 degrees\", \"R\" meaning \"turn right 90 degrees\", and \"a\" and \"b\" being ignored.  The initial position of the computer cursor is (0,0), pointing up towards (0,1).\nThen Dn is an exotic drawing known as the Heighway Dragon of order n.  For example, D10 is shown below; counting each \"F\" as one step, the highlighted spot at (18,16) is the position reached after 500 steps.\n\n\nWhat is the position of the cursor after 1012 steps in D50 ?\nGive your answer in the form x,y with no spaces.\n",

Let's call a number with this property a steady square.\nSteady squares can also be observed in other numbering systems. In the base 14 numbering system, the 3-digit number c37 is also a steady square: c372 = aa0c37, and the sum of its digits is c+3+7=18 in the same numbering system. The letters a, b, c and d are used for the 10, 11, 12 and 13 digits respectively, in a manner similar to the hexadecimal numbering system.\nFor 1 \u2264 n \u2264 9, the sum of the digits of all the n-digit steady squares in the base 14 numbering system is 2d8 (582 decimal). Steady squares with leading 0's are not allowed.\nFind the sum of the digits of all the n-digit steady squares in the base 14 numbering system for\n1 \u2264 n \u2264 10000 (decimal) and give your answer in the base 14 system using lower case letters where necessary.\n",

The only valid partition of 17 would be 8 + 9 = (23x30 + 20x32).\nMany integers have more than one valid partition, the first being 11 having the following two partitions.\n11 = 2 + 9 = (21x30 + 20x32)\n11 = 8 + 3 = (23x30 + 20x31)\nLet's define P(n) as the number of valid partitions of n. For example, P(11) = 2.\nLet's consider only the prime integers q which would have a single valid partition such as P(17).\nThe sum of the primes q <100 such that P(q)=1 equals 233.\nFind the sum of the primes q <1000000 such that P(q)=1.\n",

The winner of the race is the runner who reaches the goal first.\nInterestingly, the expected running time for the winner is $\\frac{1}{2}$, independently of the number of runners. Moreover, while it can be shown that all runners will have the same expected running time of $\\frac{n}{n+1}$, the race is still unfair, since the winning chances may differ significantly for different starting numbers:\nLet $P_{n,k}$ be the probability for runner $k$ to win a race with $n$ runners and $E_n = \\sum_{k=1}^n k P_{n,k}$ be the expected starting number of the winner in that race. It can be shown that, for example,\n$P_{3,1}=\\frac{4}{9}$, $P_{3,2}=\\frac{2}{9}$, $P_{3,3}=\\frac{1}{3}$ and $E_3=\\frac{17}{9}$ for a race with $3$ runners. \nYou are given that $E_4=2.21875$, $E_5=2.5104$ and $E_{10}=3.66021568$.\nFind $E_{1000000}$ rounded to 4 digits after the decimal point.\n",
